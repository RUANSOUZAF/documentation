A domain name is the web address or URL used to visit your site. The Domain Name System (DNS) resolves human-readable names like `www.example.com` into machine-readable internet protocol (IP) addresses like `127.0.0.1`. All Pantheon sites are accessible via platform domains, and you can easily connect your own custom domain to paid sites.
